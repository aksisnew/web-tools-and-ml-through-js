# web-tools-machine-learning-js

## Aim
- I am currently learning machine learning and artificial intelligence.I am currently exploring how can we implement some machine learning basic algorithms is password generation and various places.
- Additionally I have also made some probabalistic algorithms through js with a ui in html css

## tools
- here you will find basic tools like password generation,username generator etc but with use of some theorems like naive bayes

## Basic models
- here you will find basic algorithms like naive bayes, markov chain generator etc. implemented through js with a ui.


## How to use

- download a zip file or clone this repository and just double click the html file. therr is no node.js backend or anything else needed so it can be run without hosting through file:// protocol
